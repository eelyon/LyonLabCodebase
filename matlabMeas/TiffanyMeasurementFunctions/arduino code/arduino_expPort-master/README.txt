The folder expPort is an arduino library which supports
the I2C, 16-bit, port expansion chip MCP23016 from Microchip.

The library includes several functions to support word i/o, and
individual bit i/o. Some of the port chip's capabilities (pin
change interrupt, byte i/o, slow/fast response) are not available
with the initial version of the library.
